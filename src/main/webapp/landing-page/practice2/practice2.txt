The Bootstrap grid system has four classes: xs (phones), sm (tablets), md (desktops), and lg (larger desktops)

col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-xs-12

/////////////////

Ignoring the letters (xs, sm, md, lg) for now, I'll start with just the numbers...

the numbers (1-12) represent a portion of the total width of any div
all divs are divided into 12 columns
so, col-*-6 spans 6 of 12 columns (half the width), col-*-12 spans 12 of 12 columns (the entire width), etc
So, if you want two equal columns to span a div, write

<div class="col-xs-6">Column 1</div>
<div class="col-xs-6">Column 2</div>
Or, if you want three unequal columns to span that same width, you could write:

<div class="col-xs-2">Column 1</div>
<div class="col-xs-6">Column 2</div>
<div class="col-xs-4">Column 3</div>
You'll notice the # of columns always add up to 12. It can be less than twelve, but beware if more than 12, as your offending divs will bump down to the next row 

You can also nest columns within columns, (best with a .row wrapper around them) such as:

<div class="col-xs-6">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-4">Column 1-a</div>
    <div class="col-xs-8">Column 1-b</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-6">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-2">Column 2-a</div>
    <div class="col-xs-10">Column 2-b</div>
  </div>
</div>

///////////////////////

col-lg- stands for column large ≥ 1200px
col-md- stands for column medium ≥ 992px
col-xs- stands for column extra small ≥ 768px

Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.

The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:

xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)
sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)
md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)

seems if you uses row, then you need to use them??
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-*-*"></div>
    <div class="col-*-*"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-*-*"></div>
    <div class="col-*-*"></div>
    <div class="col-*-*"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    ...
  </div>
</div>

The CSS float property is a powerful tool used to control the horizontal positioning 
of elements within their containing elements. It allows elements to be taken out of 
the normal document flow and positioned to the left or right, enabling text and 
inline elements to wrap around them. Here’s a detailed explanation of the float 
property, its values, and practical examples.
