<!-- 
While it is common in HTML applications to place scripts at the 
end of the <body> element, it is recommended that you load the 
AngularJS library either in the <head> or at the start of the 
<body>

This is because calls to angular.module can only be compiled after 
the library has been loaded.
/////////////////
hung: round of plause to beat around the bush. why not just say? 
why beat around the bush? lol
1>load angular lib in head
2>put your script at end of body?

<script type="text/javascript" src="../../libs/angular-1.6.9.min.js"></script>
</head>

<body>

	<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">{{ firstName + " " +
		lastName }}</div>

	<!--  ///////////////////////////////////////////// -->
	<script src="myApp.js"></script>
	<script src="myCtrl.js"></script>
