example of position: relative; property. The element is shifted 50px to the right using the left property, but it still occupies its original space in the document flow.

    <style>
        div.relative {
            position: relative;
            left: 50px;
            border: 3px solid #73AD21;
        }
    </style>
    
    <div class="relative">
        This element has position:relative;
    </div>
    
The absolute element is positioned 80px from the top and right of its closest positioned ancestor (the relative container).

    <style>
        div.relative {
            position: relative;
            width: 400px;
            height: 200px;
            border: 3px solid #73AD21;
        }
        
        div.absolute {
            position: absolute;
            top: 80px;
            right: 80px;
            width: 200px;
            height: 100px;
            border: 3px solid #73AD21;
        }
    </style>
    
    <div class="relative">
        This element has position: relative;
        <div class="absolute">
            This element has position: absolute;
        </div>
    </div>
