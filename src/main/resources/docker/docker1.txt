To see whether your Linux distribution is set to WSL 1 or WSL 2, use the command: wsl -l -v.

C:\Users\ht021>wsl -l -v
  NAME      STATE           VERSION

Once you are done installing Docker, test your Docker installation by running the following:
$ docker run hello-world

PS C:\Users\ht021> wsl
ht021@lenovohung:/mnt/c/Users/ht021$ docker run --help
Usage:  docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

ht021@lenovohung:/mnt/c/Users/ht021$
C:\worksplace\sts\simple-spring-mvc\src\main\resources\docker
cd /mnt/c/worksplace/sts/simple-spring-mvc/src/main/resources/docker

In this section, we are going to run a Busybox container on our system and get a taste of the docker run command.

To get started, let's run the following in our terminal:
$ docker pull busybox
note : need docker credential...

ht021@lenovohung:/mnt/c/worksplace/sts/simple-spring-mvc/src/main/resources/docker$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
busybox      latest    f85340bf132a   10 months ago   6.55MB

Docker Run
Great! Let's now run a Docker container based on this image. To do that we are going to use the almighty docker run command.

$ docker run busybox
ht021@lenovohung:/mnt/c/worksplace/sts/simple-spring-mvc/src/main/resources/docker$ docker run busybox

When you call run, the Docker client finds the image (busybox in this case), loads up the container and then runs a command in that container. When we run docker run busybox, we didn't provide a command, so the container booted up, ran an empty command and then exited

Let's try something more exciting.

$ docker run busybox echo "hello from busybox"
hello from busybox

Nice - finally we see some output. In this case, the Docker client dutifully ran the echo command in our busybox container and then exited it. 

ht021@lenovohung:/mnt/c/worksplace/sts/simple-spring-mvc/src/main/resources/docker$ docker run busybox echo "hello from busybox"
hello from busybox

The docker ps command shows you all containers that are currently running.
ht021@lenovohung:/mnt/c/worksplace/sts/simple-spring-mvc/src/main/resources/docker$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES

-------------------
busybox

It's a just lightweight linux filesystem image for me. I'm using it for educational proposes without building a fully linux instance.
