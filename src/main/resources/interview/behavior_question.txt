STAR Technique
To answer Behavioral Questions, employ the STAR technique −

S = Situation − (recall an incident in your life that suits the situation)

T = Task − (recall an incident in your life that suits the task)

A = Action − (mention the course of action you opted to address the situation or task)

R = Result − (mention the result of your action and the outcome)

1. Tell me about an incident where you worked effectively under pressure.

pull T = Task − (recall an incident in your life that suits the task)

T − As we had already picked up specific sub-topics to talk on individually, this 
sudden addition of content did put a lot of pressure on us, especially because it 
had taken us months of research to come up with our material.

/////////////

2. Describe a bad experience you had working with your ex-employer.

Never bad-mouth previous colleagues and ex-employees. Instead of focusing on the 
details of the incident, put more emphasis on the part where you managed to make 
him see your point-of-view.

For Example − They were thinking from a different point of view, but in the end, 
they managed to understand my concerns as well.

/////////////

3. Describe how you handle disagreement.

pull T = Task − (recall an incident in your life that suits the task)

For Example − We had once designed a template for a group presentation, however one 
member wasnt too happy with him being asked to conclude. I suggested he should give 
it a trial run. At the end, he realized that he was as good at concluding as he was 
at opening a presentation.

4. Explain a situation when you explained a complex idea simply.

pull T = Task − (recall an incident in your life that suits the task)

This is a standard question in Customer Service, Sales & Marketing, IT and education 
sectors. Provide specific, job-related examples.

For Example − Yes, I designed a presentation that explained all the points in a 
clear manner. I also created a document describing the concept in simple words and 
handed it to the audience.

5. Describe a time when you had to adapt to a change at work.

Asking about incidents where you had to change your style of working is very common 
in Behavioral Interviews. Recruiters want to check your adaptability skills, as 
someone with a firm notion wont be flexible to adjust to a process.

6. Describe a time when you made a mistake.

Companies prefer candidates who have made mistakes in the past and have learnt from 
them, as opposed to those who follow rules only because someone has told them to. 
They need people who know the reason behind a decision.

Mention the mistake and be honest about it, but always make sure that you follow it 
up with what you learnt from that episode and the improvements it has brought to your 
efficiency.

For Example − In the first week of my appointment, I had miscalculated the estimated 
time needed to complete a project assigned to me, which resulted in a chain of 
miscommunications. It taught me that deadlines are to be respected.

/////////////

7. Describe a time when you delegated tasks to team-mates.

Questions about managing teams are not asked only in managerial jobs. Employers want 
to see managerial skills in their employees. They want people in their team who can 
motivate others and accomplish a task in a given time-frame. The best way to answer 
such questions will be to base your answer on capability, experience, task force, etc.

For Example − Based on their individual strengths, I delegated the complex 
algorithm-writing tasks to Tarun, as he has more experienced than the others. I asked 
Rohan to handle data check, as he was very accurate in his testing skills. I handled 
QA, as I had maximum experience in Quality Analysis.

8. Describe when you were blamed for somebody elses mistake.

These types of questions are designed to check your personality and skills at handling 
stressful situations. The standard rules of interviewing answers apply here too − no 
bad-mouthing ex-employees or supervisors.

For Example − Once I was blamed for not taking a sufficiently-detailed survey in a 
locality, which affected our sales figures for that month. Although I was not in the 
Marketing Analysis team, I took a note of the issue and, without passing blame, 
politely passed it to the concerned department.

/////////////

9. Describe a difficult situation that you faced and how you handled it.

When questions like these are asked, give an answer that portrays your ability to 
identify, analyze, and solve problems.

For Example − "We were getting a lot of complaints about the customers not getting 
the deliveries on time. I met the Manager of Delivery Department and he told me that 
the problem was acute during peak traffic hours. We both charted alternative routes 
with lesser traffic congestion during peak hours, i.e., 5:00PM till 8:00PM. Due to 
our efforts, our complaint call volume was reduced by 30%."

/////////////

10. Describe a new suggestion that you had made to your supervisor.

The ability of being a self-starter who likes to explore suitable alternatives of 
arriving at a solution and coming up with practical ideas are very important at 
any workplace.

For Example − "Our Company had launched a new product and the Sales Team were 
getting trained on it. We, being from the Orders Department, were not privy to 
the training. I requested the Management to include us in the training team too, 
as that would help us understand the orders and provide better solutions to 
customers.

/////////////

11. Describe when you had to take a judgement on a difficult decision.

By asking this question, the interviewer is checking your ability to implement 
logical decisions. You need to express your logical method of thinking out each 
step, calculating the implementation with team-mates, weighing in alternatives, 
and choosing the best action route.

For Example − "I was assigned the task of purchasing office equipment. We used 
to follow a "purchase-per-month" mode of purchase and payment. I thought of opting 
for a bulk purchase of six months, as I could hardly see the difference in payment 
in the per-month structure. Also, by ordering in bulk, we could get discounts and 
freebies. We opted for a bulk purchase in January, which proved to be a wise 
decision, as the prices of electronic goods increased by 15% with the new budget."
