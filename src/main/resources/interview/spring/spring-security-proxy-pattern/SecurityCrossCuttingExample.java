Is security a cross-cutting concern? How is it implemented? and java example 
SecurityCrossCuttingExample.java
///////////////////
Yes, security is a cross-cutting concern. A cross-cutting concern is a feature 
or aspect of a software system that affects multiple parts of the application 
but can't be cleanly separated into a single, isolated module. Security, like 
logging, transaction management, and caching, touches almost every component 
of an application, from authentication and authorization to data validation 
and communication protocols.
/////////////////////
How It's Implemented
Implementing security as a cross-cutting concern typically involves using AOP 
(Aspect-Oriented Programming) principles, even if not using a formal AOP 
framework. The core idea is to separate the security logic (the "aspect") 
from the main business logic (the "join points"). This separation helps avoid 
scattering security code throughout the application, which would make the 
system harder to maintain, understand, and secure.
The implementation often follows these steps:

1>Interception: The application intercepts requests or method calls at specific 
points. These points, called join points, are where the security logic needs 
to be applied.
2>Aspects: A dedicated module or class, the aspect, contains the security logic. 
This could be a set of rules for authentication or a check for user permissions.
3>Weaving: The aspect is then "woven" into the application's code at the join 
points. This weaving can happen at different stages:
a>Compile-time: The security code is injected directly into the bytecode.
b>Load-time: A special class loader modifies the bytecode as it's being loaded 
into the JVM.
c>Run-time: The interception is handled by proxies or dynamic proxies, which are 
objects that wrap the target object and apply the security logic before or after 
the method call.
////////////////////////
In Java, a common way to implement security as a cross-cutting concern is by using 
a proxy pattern or a framework like Spring Security.
Proxy Pattern Example

Without a framework, you can use the proxy pattern to wrap a business object with 
security checks. Let's say we have a ReportService with a generateReport() method.
///////////////////////////
In this example, the SecuredReportServiceProxy is the "aspect" that contains the 
security logic. It intercepts the generateReport() method call and applies the 
security check before delegating the call to the actual ReportServiceImpl. The 
business logic remains clean and unaware of the security implementation.

// 4. Usage
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // User with proper access
        ReportService adminService = new SecuredReportServiceProxy(new ReportServiceImpl(), "ADMIN");
        adminService.generateReport();

        System.out.println("--------------------");

        // User without proper access
        ReportService userService = new SecuredReportServiceProxy(new ReportServiceImpl(), "USER");
        userService.generateReport();
    }
}
