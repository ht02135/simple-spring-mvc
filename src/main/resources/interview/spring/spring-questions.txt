    Spring AOP: This is one of the key components of Spring. It is used for providing declarative enterprise services.
    Spring ORM: This is related to database access, and it provides integration layers for popular object-relational mapping APIs, including JDO, Hibernate, and iBatis.
    Spring Web: This is part of Spring’s web application development stack.
    Spring DAO: The DAO (Data Access Object) support helps standardize the data access work using JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO.
    Spring Context: This builds on the beans package to support message sources and the Observer design pattern.
    Spring Web MVC: This provides the MVC implementations for the web applications.
    Spring Core: The most crucial component of the Spring Framework. It provides Dependency Injection features.

Q3. Explain the difference between singleton and prototype bean.

Singleton refers to a single object instance per Spring IOC container. On the other hand, Prototype refers to a single bean definition to any number of object instances.

Q4. What can you do in Spring java based configuration?

You can inject all dependencies using java class only, using @Configuaration and @Bean annotations.

Q5. Explain the bean lifecycle in the Spring bean Factory container?

    The Spring container instantiates the bean from the bean’s definition in the XML file, and Spring populates the properties using the dependency injection.
    By passing the bean’s ID, the factory calls setBeanName() if the bean implements the BeanNameAware interface.
    If the bean implements the BeanFactoryAware interface, the factory calls setBeanFactory() by passing an instance of itself.
    preProcessBeforeInitialization() methods are carried out if any BeanPostProcessors are associated with the bean.
    Finally, postProcessAfterInitialization() methods are carried out if any BeanPostProcessors are associated with the bean.

Q6. Explain bean wiring.

Bean wiring refers to when beans are combined within the Spring container. The Spring container needs to know what beans are needed and how dependency injection should wire the beans.

Q7. What are the ways by which Hibernate can be accessed using Spring?

There are two ways to access Hibernate using Spring:

    Inversion of Control with a Hibernate Template and Callback
    Extending HibernateDAOSupport and Applying an AOP Interceptor node

Q8. Explain JoinPoint.

A point during the execution of a program is called JoinPoint. In Spring AOP, a joinpoint always indicates a method execution.

Q9. What is Spring Configuration File?

Spring Configuration File is an XML file that contains all the information about classes and their configuration process and how the classes have interacted with the other classes.

Q10. Explain weaving in the Spring framework.

It refers to linking an aspect with other application types or objects to create an advised object is called Weaving. In Spring AOP, this process is performed at runtime.
