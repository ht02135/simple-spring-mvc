Spring Hibernate Interview Questions

/////////////////////////

1>What are the ways to access Hibernate by using Spring?

1>Spring Data JPA (Recommended for modern applications):

1a>This is the preferred approach for new projects. Spring Data JPA 
significantly simplifies data access by providing powerful repository 
abstractions.
1b>You define interfaces that extend Spring Data JPA's JpaRepository 
(or other repository interfaces like CrudRepository).
1c>Spring automatically generates the implementation for these interfaces 
at runtime, handling common CRUD operations and allowing for custom 
queries based on method names or @Query annotations.
1d>Hibernate acts as the underlying JPA provider, managing the 
object-relational mapping and database interactions.

2>ative Hibernate SessionFactory Integration:

2a>This method directly exposes Hibernate's SessionFactory within 
the Spring container.
2b>You configure LocalSessionFactoryBean in your Spring configuration 
(either Java-based or XML-based) to set up the SessionFactory.
2c>You then inject the SessionFactory into your DAOs (Data Access Objects) 
and use it to obtain Session instances for performing database operations.
2d>While still supported, this approach is less common in new development 
compared to Spring Data JPA, as it requires more boilerplate code for basic operations.
