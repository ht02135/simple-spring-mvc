Spring Annotations Interview Questions

/////////////////

1>How can annotation wiring be turned on in Spring?

To enable annotation wiring in Spring, you need to configure your Spring application context to scan for components and process annotations.

Annotation-Based Configuration
There are a few ways to turn on annotation wiring, depending on whether you're using XML, Java-based configuration, or a combination of both.

---------------
1. Java-based Configuration

This is the modern and preferred approach.

@Configuration and @ComponentScan: The key is to use the @Configuration 
annotation on a class to declare it as a Spring configuration class and 
@ComponentScan to tell Spring where to look for components (beans) 
annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller.
    
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.yourpackage")
public class AppConfig {
    // You can define other beans here if needed
}

The basePackages attribute specifies the package(s) to scan. Spring will 
automatically find classes like this one:

@Service
public class MyService {
    // Spring will inject a MyRepository bean here
    @Autowired
    private MyRepository myRepository;
}

@Repository
public class MyRepository {
    // ...
}

-----------------------

2. XML-based Configuration

If you're using XML, you can enable annotation processing with the 
<context:component-scan> element.

<context:component-scan>: Add this element to your XML application context file, 
specifying the base package to scan.
    
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans 
           https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context 
           https://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

    <context:component-scan base-package="com.example.yourpackage"/>

</beans>

The base-package attribute works just like the basePackages in the Java 
configuration, telling Spring where to search for annotated components.

ðŸ’¡ Note: In older versions of Spring (prior to 2.5), you might have had 
to explicitly declare <context:annotation-config/> to enable annotations 
like @Autowired. The <context:component-scan/> element now implicitly 
includes the functionality of <context:annotation-config/>, so you generally 
don't need both.

Common Annotations for Wiring

Once annotation wiring is enabled, Spring processes these key annotations 
to manage dependencies:

    @Autowired: This is the most common annotation for injecting dependencies. 
    Spring automatically finds a matching bean and injects it. It can be 
    used on constructors, setters, or fields.

    @Qualifier: Used with @Autowired to specify a particular bean when there 
    are multiple beans of the same type.

    @Component: A generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.

    @Service: A specialization of @Component for the service layer.

    @Repository: A specialization of @Component for the data access layer.

    @Controller: A specialization of @Component for the web layer.

By using one of the configuration methods above, you give Spring the green 
light to scan, find, and wire these annotated components together, 
automatically managing the dependencies in your application.
