1>What is the security filter chain in Spring Security? and java example 

The security filter chain in Spring Security is a series of filters 
that process incoming HTTP requests to apply security measures. 

Each filter in the chain has a specific purpose, such as authentication, 
authorization, or handling exceptions. When an HTTP request arrives, 
it passes through this chain of filters in a predefined order. 

If a filter determines that the request is not authorized or authenticated, 
it can reject the request, preventing it from reaching the application's 
resources.

2>Describe some of the predefined filters used by Spring Security. What are 
their functions, and in which order do they occur? and java example 

Spring Security uses a chain of filters to handle a request's security aspects, 
like authentication and authorization. Each filter in the chain has a specific 
purpose and operates in a predetermined order. While you can customize and add 
your own, here are some key predefined filters and their functions:

Predefined Filters and Functions

1>SecurityContextPersistenceFilter: This is typically the first filter in the 
chain. Its job is to populate the SecurityContextHolder with the user's 
authentication information, usually from the HTTP session. It ensures the 
security context is available to other filters and components for the duration 
of the request.

2>UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter: This filter processes form-based logins. 
It extracts the username and password from the request and attempts to authenticate 
the user. If successful, it creates an Authentication object and stores it in 
the SecurityContextHolder.

3>LogoutFilter: This filter handles logout requests. It's responsible for invalidating 
the session, clearing the SecurityContext, and redirecting the user to a specified 
logout success URL.

4>ExceptionTranslationFilter: This filter is crucial for handling security-related 
exceptions. It catches AuthenticationException and AccessDeniedException and then 
either redirects the user to an authentication entry point (like a login page) 
or invokes an AccessDeniedHandler to handle the error.

5>FilterSecurityInterceptor: This is one of the last filters in the chain. It 
enforces authorization rules. It inspects the request and checks if the authenticated 
user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. If not, it 
throws an AccessDeniedException.

3>How will you implement a custom filter in Spring Security? and java example 

To implement a custom filter in Spring Security, you'll need to create a 
filter class, configure it to be managed by Spring, and then add it to 
the filter chain at the appropriate position. A custom filter is essential 
when you need to perform actions like API key validation, token-based 
authentication, or logging before the request reaches the application's endpoints.

Step 1: Create the Custom Filter Class
First, create a class that extends OncePerRequestFilter. This abstract class 
guarantees that your filter's doFilterInternal method will only be called 
once per request, which prevents redundant processing.

This example filter CustomAuthenticationFilter checks for a header named X-API-Key. If the header 
exists and its value is "my-secret-key", the filter allows the request 
to proceed. Otherwise, it sends an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response.

Step 2: Configure the Filter in Spring Security
Next, you need to register your custom filter CustomAuthenticationFilterConfig.java with Spring's security 
configuration. You'll use the SecurityFilterChain bean to define 
the order of the filters.

Spring interview questions cover a wide range of Spring concepts. You must be familiar with all of them to pass the interview. We hope that these sample Spring interview questions will help you with your preparations.
