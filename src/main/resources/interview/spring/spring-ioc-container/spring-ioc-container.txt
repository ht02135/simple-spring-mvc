Spring IoC Interview Questions

/////////////////

1>What are IoC and DI in Spring? and java and xml example

    In Spring, IoC (Inversion of Control) and DI (Dependency Injection) are 
    fundamental concepts that help build loosely coupled and modular applications. 
    IoC is the principle, and DI is a specific design pattern that implements 
    that principle.

	Inversion of Control (IoC)
	IoC is a design principle where the framework, rather than the application code, 
	takes control of object creation, configuration, and lifecycle management. 
	Traditionally, you'd create objects within your code using the new keyword. 
	With IoC, the Spring container "inverts" this control, handling the instantiation 
	and wiring of objects (beans) for you.  This means your code focuses on 
	its business logic, delegating the object management responsibilities to 
	the framework.  
	hung: ioc is spring framework manage pojo obj lifecycle.

    Dependency Injection (DI)
	DI is the most common implementation of IoC in Spring. It's a design pattern 
	where an object receives its dependencies (other objects it needs to function) 
	from an external source, rather than creating them itself. Instead of a class 
	looking up or creating its dependencies, the Spring container "injects" them 
	into the class. The dependencies are typically provided through a constructor, 
	setter method, or field.
	hung: di is pojo obj receive its dependencies from externaal source.

    1>Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided through the class's constructor. 
    This is the preferred method as it ensures the object is created with all 
    its necessary dependencies and makes the object immutable.
	2>Setter Injection: Dependencies are provided through setter methods. This is 
	useful for optional dependencies or for classes that need to be reconfigured 
	at runtime.
	3>Field Injection: Dependencies are injected directly into a field using 
	annotations. While convenient, it's generally discouraged in favor of 
	constructor injection because it hides dependencies and makes the class harder to test.

    In this code, the NotificationService doesn't create a MessageService instance 
    itself. Instead, it declares its dependency in the constructor. Spring's 
    @Autowired annotation tells the container to find a bean that implements 
    the MessageService interface (in this case, EmailService) and inject it.
    
    1><beans>: This is the root element of the Spring configuration file. It 
    contains the definitions for all your beans.
	2><bean>: This element defines a single bean. The id attribute is the 
	unique name of the bean, and the class attribute specifies the fully 
	qualified class name.
	3><constructor-arg>: This element is used to inject a dependency into a 
	bean's constructor. The ref attribute points to the ID of another bean 
	(emailService in this case) that will be passed into the constructor of 
	the notificationService bean. This is how Dependency Injection is 
	configured in XML.
	4><property>: An alternative to <constructor-arg>, this element is used 
	for setter injection. You would use it like <property name="messageService" 
	ref="emailService"/> if NotificationService had a setMessageService method.

----------------

	I cannot provide a single applicationContext.xml example that demonstrates all 
	five types of injection, as field injection is an annotation-based approach 
	and isn't configured directly in the XML file. Instead, the XML configuration 
	enables the scanning of Java classes where field injection is used.

	Here is an example that demonstrates the other four types of injection directly 
	within the applicationContext.xml file, along with the necessary configuration 
	to support annotation-based field injection in your Java code.

	Key Takeaways
    1>Constructor Injection: The <constructor-arg> tag specifies the values or 
    references to be passed to a bean's constructor. This is useful for mandatory 
    dependencies.

    2>Setter Injection: The <property> tag with a name attribute matching a 
    setter method is used to inject dependencies or values. Itâ€™s useful for 
    optional dependencies.
    hung : i think setter injection is for bean compatible thing..

    3>ref Injection: This is a type of setter or constructor injection where 
    the <property> or <constructor-arg> tag uses the ref attribute to point 
    to another bean's ID, linking the two.

    4>value Injection: Similar to ref but uses the value attribute to inject 
    literal values (e.g., strings, numbers) instead of other beans.

    5>Field Injection: This method is not configured directly in XML. Instead, 
    you use <context:component-scan> to tell Spring to look for annotations 
    (@Autowired, @Resource, etc.) in your Java code. Spring then automatically 
    injects the dependencies into the annotated fields, making the XML 
    configuration cleaner.
    
    hung: now i see why field injection should be avoid, because CANT DO IT for xml

2>What is the use of IoC containers?

What is the use of IoC containers?
1>IoC containers are frameworks that manage object creation, configuration, 
and lifecycle in applications. Their primary uses include:

2>Dependency Management: IoC containers automatically create and inject 
dependencies into objects, eliminating the need for manual object 
instantiation. Instead of objects creating their own dependencies, 
the container provides them.

3>Loose Coupling: By managing dependencies externally, IoC containers 
reduce tight coupling between classes. Objects depend on abstractions 
(interfaces) rather than concrete implementations, making code more 
flexible and maintainable.

4>Configuration Centralization: All dependency configurations are 
managed in one place (XML files, annotations, or configuration classes), 
making it easier to modify application behavior without changing source 
code.

5>Lifecycle Management: Containers handle object creation, initialization, 
and destruction, including managing singleton patterns, prototype instances, 
and cleanup operations.

6>Testing Enhancement: IoC containers make unit testing easier by allowing 
easy substitution of mock objects or test implementations for real 
dependencies.

3>What is autowiring, and name the different modes of it?

What is autowiring, and what are the different modes?
Autowiring is a feature that automatically injects dependencies into 
objects without explicit configuration. The container automatically 
identifies and injects the required dependencies based on various 
strategies.

The different autowiring modes are:
1>No Autowiring (default): Dependencies must be explicitly defined 
through configuration. No automatic injection occurs.

	<bean id="serviceA" class="com.example.ServiceA" />
	<bean id="clientA" class="com.example.ClientA">
		<property name="serviceA" ref="serviceA" />
	</bean>
	
2>By Name: The container matches property names with bean names in 
the configuration. If a property named "userService" exists, it looks 
for a bean with the same name.

	<bean id="serviceB" class="com.example.ServiceB" />
	<bean id="clientB" class="com.example.ClientB" autowire="byName" />
	
3>By Type: The container injects dependencies based on the property's 
data type. It searches for beans that match the required type and 
injects them automatically.

	<bean id="someServiceC" class="com.example.ServiceC" />
	<bean id="clientC" class="com.example.ClientC" autowire="byType" />
	
4>By Constructor: Dependencies are injected through constructor 
parameters. The container uses reflection to determine constructor
 parameter types and injects matching beans.
 
	<bean id="serviceD" class="com.example.ServiceD" />
	<bean id="clientD" class="com.example.ClientD"
		autowire="constructor" />
		
5>Autodetect: The container first attempts constructor autowiring. 
If no suitable constructor is found, it falls back to autowiring 
by type for properties.

The autodetect option is deprecated.  so eclipse will alert as error

	<bean id="serviceE" class="com.example.ServiceE" />
	<bean id="clientE" class="com.example.ClientE"
		autowire="autodetect" />
		
These autowiring modes provide different levels of automation and 
flexibility, allowing developers to choose the approach that best 
fits their application's architecture and requirements.

4>What is DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC? In other words, can you 
explain the Spring MVC architecture?

The DispatcherServlet is the front controller in a Spring MVC web application. 
It's the central point of entry for all incoming HTTP requests. Its primary 
role is to manage and orchestrate the entire request-handling process by 
delegating tasks to other components within the Spring framework.  
This single-servlet design is a key feature of the Spring MVC framework, 
as it consolidates the request flow, making the application more manageable 
and extensible.

The Spring MVC Architecture and Request Flow

The Spring MVC framework follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design 
pattern, separating the application's concerns into three distinct layers:

1>Model: Represents the application's data and business logic. It's 
responsible for managing and manipulating data.

2>View: Handles the presentation layer, rendering the data from the 
Model into a format the user can understand, such as HTML.

3>Controller: Acts as the intermediary, receiving user requests, 
processing them by interacting with the Model, and then selecting 
the appropriate View to display the result.

-------------------

The request flow in a Spring MVC application is a well-defined 
sequence of steps orchestrated by the DispatcherServlet:

1>Incoming Request: A user sends an HTTP request to the web application.

2>DispatcherServlet intercepts: The DispatcherServlet, configured as 
the front controller, receives the request.

	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>mvc</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>
			org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet
		</servlet-class>
		<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
	</servlet>

3>Handler Mapping: The DispatcherServlet consults a HandlerMapping to 
determine which controller is responsible for handling the specific 
request, based on its URL and other parameters.

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>mvc</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/mvc/*</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>

4>Controller Execution: The DispatcherServlet sends the request to the 
identified Controller. The controller processes the request, performs 
any necessary business logic (often by interacting with a service or 
data access layer), and prepares data to be displayed.

5>Model and View: The controller returns a ModelAndView object, which 
contains the data (Model) to be displayed and the logical name of the 
View to be rendered.

6>View Resolution: The DispatcherServlet uses a ViewResolver to map the 
logical view name to an actual view component, such as a JSP file or 
a Thymeleaf template.

7>Rendering the View: The DispatcherServlet passes the model data to 
the resolved view. The view then renders the final output (e.g., an 
HTML page) with the provided data.

8>Final Response: The DispatcherServlet sends the rendered response 
back to the client's browser.

This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the 
application easier to develop, maintain, and scale.

5>Which method is used for shutting down IoC containers in Spring?

The close() method is used for shutting down an IoC container in Spring.

Specifically, for an ApplicationContext (which is the more common 
type of Spring container in modern applications), the close() method 
is used to destroy all the beans in the container, releasing any 
resources they might hold. The ConfigurableApplicationContext 
interface provides this close() method, and most concrete 
ApplicationContext implementations (like ClassPathXmlApplicationContext 
or AnnotationConfigApplicationContext) inherit it.

While a web application's container is typically managed automatically 
when the application is shut down, in standalone applications, it's a 
good practice to explicitly call the close() method to ensure a clean 
shutdown.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load context
        ConfigurableApplicationContext context =
                new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");

        // Get bean
        ResourceBean bean = context.getBean("resourceBean", ResourceBean.class);
        bean.doWork();

        // Explicit shutdown (important for standalone apps)
        context.close();
    }
    
    <!-- Demo bean with init and destroy methods -->
    <bean id="resourceBean" class="com.example.ResourceBean"
          init-method="init"
          destroy-method="cleanup"/>

6>What is the implementation of List that is used when you use the <list> tag in a bean definition?
7>How do you use a particular implementation of collection in your bean definition?
8>Are singleton beans in Spring a regular singleton object?
9>If an inner bean is defined with an id, can you use this id to fetch the bean from the container?
10>What are the actuator-provided endpoints used for monitoring the Spring boot application?
