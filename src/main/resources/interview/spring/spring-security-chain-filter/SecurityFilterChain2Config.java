////////////////////////
you’re asking for a Java example that demonstrates how the following Spring 
Security filters work together:

SecurityContextPersistenceFilter
UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter
ExceptionTranslationFilter
FilterSecurityInterceptor

These are core filters in Spring Security’s filter chain, usually auto-configured. 
But you can explicitly configure them in a demo to see how they interact.
Here’s a minimal Spring Boot (or vanilla Spring MVC) example showing how these 
filters can be wired:
SecurityFilterChain2Config.java (Java-based Spring Security configuration)
//////////////////
What Each Filter Does in This Example

SecurityContextPersistenceFilter
Loads the SecurityContext from HttpSession at the beginning of a request, 
and stores it back at the end.
→ Ensures logged-in user is remembered across requests.

UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter
Intercepts the login POST request (/login by default), authenticates credentials, 
and stores Authentication in the SecurityContext.

ExceptionTranslationFilter
Catches AccessDeniedException and AuthenticationException.
→ Redirects unauthenticated users to /login.
→ Shows 403 Forbidden for authenticated but unauthorized users.

FilterSecurityInterceptor
Performs authorization based on URL patterns & roles.
→ Throws exceptions handled by ExceptionTranslationFilter.

        	currently authenticated user, is available throughout the request.
        	////////////////
        	1>Example Scenario: A user has already logged in and is now trying to 
        	access a protected page, say /dashboard.
			2>What it does: When the request for /dashboard arrives, the 
			SecurityContextPersistenceFilter intercepts it. It looks for a valid 
			session (e.g., a JSESSIONID cookie) and, if found, retrieves the 
			associated authentication information from the session. It then 
			populates the SecurityContextHolder with this information, making 
			the user's authentication details accessible to subsequent filters 
			and your application code.

        	password to the /login endpoint.
        	2>What it does: The UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter is 
        	configured to listen for requests to this endpoint. It extracts 
        	the username and password from the request parameters. It then 
        	creates an Authentication object and passes it to the AuthenticationManager 
        	for verification. If the AuthenticationManager successfully authenticates 
        	the user, the filter will create a new Authentication object (with more 
        	details, like roles) and store it in the SecurityContextHolder and the session.
        	*/

        	ExceptionTranslationFilter
        	This filter catches security-related exceptions and translates them into 
        	appropriate HTTP responses, like redirects.
        	1>Example Scenario: An unauthenticated user tries to access a protected page, 
        	or a logged-in user with insufficient roles attempts to access a resource 
        	they don't have permission for.
        	2>Unauthenticated Access: A user tries to go to /dashboard without logging in. 
        	The FilterSecurityInterceptor (see next section) throws an AuthenticationException. 
        	The ExceptionTranslationFilter catches this. It then redirects the user to 
        	the configured login page (e.g., /login).
        	3>Access Denied: A logged-in user with the "USER" role tries to access /admin/dashboard, 
        	but only "ADMIN" users are allowed. The FilterSecurityInterceptor throws an 
        	AccessDeniedException. The ExceptionTranslationFilter catches this and invokes a 
        	configured Access Denied Handler to display a 403 Forbidden page.

        	/*
        	FilterSecurityInterceptor
        	This is the final authorization filter in the chain. It's responsible for making 
        	the final decision on whether a request can proceed based on the user's roles 
        	and permissions.
        	1>Example Scenario: A user who has successfully logged in tries to access 
        	/admin/dashboard.
        	2>What it does: The FilterSecurityInterceptor receives the request. It looks 
        	at the configuration to see if there are any rules for the requested URL 
        	(/admin/dashboard). It finds a rule like hasRole('ADMIN'). It then checks 
        	the Authentication object (which was placed in the SecurityContextHolder by 
        	the authentication filters) to see if the user has the "ADMIN" role.
        	a>If the user has the role: The request is allowed to continue to the controller.
			b>If the user does not have the role: The filter throws an AccessDeniedException, 
			which is then handled by the ExceptionTranslationFilter.
