ConcurrentHashMapExample.java
///////////////////
1. Synchronization
Hashtable:
Entire map is synchronized.
Every method (get, put, etc.) is synchronized on the whole object.
This leads to a lot of contention in multi-threaded applications.

ConcurrentHashMap:
Uses fine-grained locking (in Java 7, segmented locks; in Java 8+, bucket-level 
CAS + synchronized blocks).
Multiple threads can read/write different parts of the map at the same time.
Much faster under concurrency.
///////////////////
3. Iterators
Hashtable: Iterator is fail-fast (will throw ConcurrentModificationException 
if the map is modified while iterating).
ConcurrentHashMap: Iterator is weakly consistent (doesnâ€™t throw exceptions, 
reflects some but not all modifications).
///////////////////
4. Performance
Hashtable: Slower under high concurrency because of full synchronization.
ConcurrentHashMap: Much faster because of fine-grained locking.
/////////////////
When to Use
Hashtable: Almost never in modern applications (kept for backward compatibility).
ConcurrentHashMap: Use when you need a thread-safe, high-performance map.
