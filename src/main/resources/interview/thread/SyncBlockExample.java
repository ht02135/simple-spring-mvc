/////////////////////
Synchronized Method: In this method, the thread acquires a lock on the object when 
they enter the synchronized method and releases the lock either normally or by 
throwing an exception when they leave the method.  No other thread can use the 
whole method unless and until the current thread finishes its execution and 
release the lock. It can be used when one wants to lock on the entire functionality 
of a particular method. 

Synchronized Block: In this method, the thread acquires a lock on the object 
between parentheses after the synchronized keyword, and releases the lock when 
they leave the block. No other thread can acquire a lock on the locked object 
unless and until the synchronized block exists. It can be used when one wants 
to keep other parts of the programs accessible to other threads.
 
Synchronized blocks should be preferred more as it boosts the performance of a 
particular program. It only locks a certain part of the program (critical section) 
rather than the entire method and therefore leads to less contention
