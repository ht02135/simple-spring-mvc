1. Tell me about yourself

Unlike 80% of the candidates who ramble about their life story and personal matters, 
start with the present and explain how your qualifications match to what the 
interviewer is looking for, and how you are an ideal candidate for the job. This 
approach will help you stand out instantly from the rest of the aspirants and 
will help you build a rapport very early.

2. What are your greatest strengths?

Most aspirants sound either too arrogant or humble while answering these questions, 
neither of which helps. The key skill here is to mention work-elated strengths 
along with their most recent and impressive examples respectively.

For example − The qualities employers generally seek in employees are −

Proven Performance Record	Intelligence
Familiarity with Corporate Culture	Honesty
Communication Skills	Enthusiasm
Ease of Approachability	Dedication
Confidence	Definiteness

3. What are your greatest weaknesses?


First of all, theres nothing great about a weakness, so thats a trick question; 
it should be What are your biggest weaknesses?

Second, being honest about your weaknesses might earn you brownie points on 
sincerity, however a candidate with weaknesses isnt a charming prospect for 
any company. Many tackle this question by trying to present their excessive 
implementation of a positive quality as a negative feature.

For example − I strive to achieve perfection, so I tend to work too hard.

However, these tactics have been used for so long now that every HR will see 
through it. The best way to answer this question is to first get a detailed 
knowledge of the jobs requirements, and then describe what you like doing the 
most, which should match up with the most important qualification in the 
position. Also, mention what you like the least, which should match with a 
qualification not at all needed for the job.

For example − If you are applying for a job that needs knowledge on Website 
Designing, say −

"Nobody's perfect, but if my background is anything to go by, I have the 
qualifications, skills and focus to achieve results in this position. If 
given a choice, I like to spend the majority of my employed time in designing 
the websites, as opposed to Data Warehousing. Of course, I know the importance 
of Data Warehousing, but my real interest lies in website designing." (The HRs 
heart would be singing in delight on hearing those words.)

4. Tell me about an incident you are ashamed of speaking about.

Although its one of those extremely personal questions that the interviewer has no 
business asking, its extremely effective in inducing guilt and repentance from an 
unprepared candidate, which could lead to disaster.

Never treat a mistake you made as something shameful, as that means you have 
difficulty in moving on, instead of learning from the mistake and avoiding that 
in your present life. Never regret or apologize for a mistake.

For example − I have always found the best way to manage a shameful act is to not 
do it in the first place. I always cross-check my references and prepare the 
task-chart for the next day well in advance, so that I am rarely caught on 
the wrong foot.

6. The Silent Treatment.
A favorite of the HRs who put candidates in Stress situations, this technique 
involves the interviewer remaining completely silent and just keep on staring 
back after an aspirant has answered the question. This uncomfortable and prolonged 
silence has an unnerving effect on even the most seasoned job-seekers.

Most unprepared candidates think they might have said something extremely wrong 
which they have to cover now. But as they dont know what was wrong in the first 
place, they break under the stress and rush to fill in the silence by rambling 
about unnecessary details, which might be extremely dangerous to your chances.

For example − If your interviewer remains silent for an uncomfortable duration 
after listening to your answer, keep quiet for some time and then, say very 
politely − "Is there anything else I need to mention on that point?"

7. Why should I hire you?
Before answering any such question, do a thorough study of the positions 
requirements and what skill-sets the job might need. This knowledge will 
help you immensely in matching your qualifications and experience with the 
job requirements, which in turn, enhances your image in the eyes of the HR 
and sets you apart from the competition.

For example − "As per my knowledge, you are looking for a Sales and Marketing 
Manager for your book-publishing department. I would like to mention that I 
have a strong background in trade book sales, 18 years of experience to be 
exact. I know the right contacts, methods, and management techniques that 
are needed for success in our industry.

/////////////

8. Where do you see yourself five years from now?
The reason interviewers ask this question is to check your level of commitment 
to the job and company. They want to know if you are just filling in till a 
better opportunity comes along, or are you looking for a long-term association 
with the organization.

For example − "This position is exactly what I'm looking forward to working 
in on a long term, and I'm confident that if I do my work with sincerity and 
the desired level of proficiency, opportunities will inevitably open up for 
me."

/////////////

9. Why do you want to work at our company?
The deeper your research is on the companys annual reports, the corporate 
newsletters, business contacts, partners, suppliers, advertisements and 
articles about the company in the trade press, the better chance you have 
at answering this question satisfactorily.

/////////////

10. Would you lie for the company?
This is one of the trickiest questions in the world of interviewing, as it 
pits two morals against each other − loyalty vs. honesty.

For example − In these cases, try to give an answer thats as diplomatic as 
possible, like − I will never do anything that could cast a shadow on the 
companys image and reputation. I will always consult with my seniors before 
taking a decision, so that they can guide me with their expertise and 
level of experience.

11. Questions on confidential matters.
Your interviewer may press you for this information for two reasons. First, to 
research the competition on their strategies, financial condition, etc. Second, 
to test your integrity to see if you can easily reveal confidential data. Never 
reveal anything truly confidential about a present or former employer, but 
politely explain the reason too.

For example − "I certainly like to be as clear as possible, however I would 
also like to honor the trust my previous employer had on me, when they shared 
sensitive information, as I am sure you would also want your employers to do.
