this explain what opswork do.  which many tutorial on internet MESS explaination...

i gave some thought about opswork

1>cloudformation does aws provision such as setup vpc, public/private subnet, internet gateway (include routing), nat gateway (include routing), vpc, public/private security group (including routing)

2>but who setup java, tomcat, upload war?  of course those can be done manually?  but i think the so call opsworks=config application part refer to this part for example setup 'java in ec2, tomcat in ec2, upload war to tomcat'

translate into : pretty much rest of configuration not done by cloudformation (just provision aws resources via template) need ALL be done opsworks then...  pretty obvious right??

For example, if you store applications in one of the standard repositories, you can use the built-in deploy recipes to handle much of the work of installing the applications on the layer's instances.

The following walkthrough describes how to implement a custom layer that supports a Tomcat application server. The layer is based on a custom cookbook named Tomcat, which includes recipes to handle package installation, deployment, and so on.
