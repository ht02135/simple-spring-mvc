Elasticsearch - Search APIs

This API is used to search content in Elasticsearch. A user can search by sending a get request with query string as a parameter or they can post a query in the message body of post request. Mainly all the search APIS are multi-index, multi-type.

////////////////////

Multi-Index

Elasticsearch allows us to search for the documents present in all the indices or in some specific indices. For example, if we need to search all the documents with a name that contains central, we can do as shown here −

GET /_all/_search?q=city:paprola 

///////////////////////

Request Body Search

We can also specify query using query DSL in request body and there are many examples already given in previous chapters. One such example is given here −

POST /schools/_search
{
   "query":{
      "query_string":{
         "query":"up"
      }
   }
}
