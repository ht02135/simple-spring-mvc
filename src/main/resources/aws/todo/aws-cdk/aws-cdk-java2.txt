translate to hand build cloudformation via yml/json is probably counter productive (aka waste of time) than building it object oriented way via builder pattern...  after all provision of aws resource should scream builder pattern no?  so forget cloudformation via yml/json and hello cdk java.

then harvest the actual cloudformation template via cdk synth
