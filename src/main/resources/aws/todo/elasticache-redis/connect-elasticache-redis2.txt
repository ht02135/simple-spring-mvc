A Simple Guide to Connect to Amazon ElastiCache Redis from Outside of Amazon 

In this chapter, we will talk about these solutions:

Part 1 - Configure Security Group for ElastiCache Redis Access: We will learn how to set up security groups to let traffic in from our external IP.

Part 3 - Use an SSH Tunnel to Access ElastiCache Redis: We will understand how to make an SSH tunnel for safe connections to our Redis.

Part 6 - Implement IAM Roles and Policies for Secure Access: We will learn how to control access with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

1>Part 1 - Configure Security Group for ElastiCache Redis Access

To connect to Amazon ElastiCache Redis from outside of Amazon, we need to configure the security group for our ElastiCache Redis instance. This means we must allow traffic from our local machine’s IP address.

    Access the AWS Management Console:
        Go to the ElastiCache service.

    Select Your Redis Cluster:
        Click on the Redis option. Then choose the Redis cluster we want to set up.

    Locate the Security Group:
        In the cluster details, we find the Security Group ID connected to our Redis instance. We click on it to open the security group settings in the EC2 console.

    Edit Inbound Rules:
        Click on the Inbound rules tab. Then click on Edit inbound rules.
        We add a new rule with these settings:
            Type: Custom TCP
            Protocol: TCP
            Port Range: 6379 (this is the default port for Redis)
            Source: Our local machine’s IP address in CIDR notation (like 203.0.113.0/32 <-- some how i think this is stupid).

    Save Rules:

3>Part 3 - Use an SSH Tunnel to Access ElastiCache Redis

To connect to Amazon ElastiCache Redis from outside AWS, we can use an SSH tunnel. Here are the steps we need to follow:

a>Set Up an EC2 Instance: First, we need an EC2 instance in the same VPC as our ElastiCache Redis cluster. 
    
b>Configure Security Groups:

    We should change the security group of the ElastiCache Redis cluster. It needs to allow incoming traffic from the EC2 instance on the Redis port. The default port is 6379.
    We also need to make sure the EC2 instance’s security group allows SSH access on port 22 from our local machine’s IP. <-- hung : not big fan of locking down to one local machine ip...

c>Establish SSH Tunnel: We can use this command to create an SSH tunnel. This is from our local machine to the ElastiCache Redis instance through the EC2 instance.

ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem -L 6379:<elasticache-endpoint>:6379 ec2-user@<ec2-public-ip>

d>Connect Using Redis CLI: After we set up the SSH tunnel, we can connect to our ElastiCache Redis using the Redis CLI from our local machine.

redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379

This command will send our Redis commands through the SSH tunnel to the ElastiCache Redis cluster. If we want to learn more about Redis commands, we can check this guide on how to use Redis commands.

By using an SSH tunnel, we make sure we can access our Amazon ElastiCache Redis securely. It also keeps it safe from being exposed directly to the internet.

Part 4 - Expose ElastiCache Redis via a Public IP (Not Recommended)

We do not recommend exposing your Amazon ElastiCache Redis instance with a public IP. It can cause security problems. But if we must do it, here are the steps.

    Modify Security Group:
        Go to the AWS Management Console.
        Click on the EC2 service and then Security Groups.
        Find the security group for your ElastiCache Redis instance.
        Add a rule for Redis (default port 6379):
            Type: Custom TCP
            Protocol: TCP
            Port Range: 6379
            Source: Your IP address (or 0.0.0.0/0 for all IPs, but this is not good)

    Here is an Example Inbound Rule:

    Type        Protocol      Port Range      Source
    Custom TCP  TCP           6379            xx.xx.xx.xx/32

    Assign Public IP:
        Make sure your ElastiCache Redis cluster is in a subnet with a public IP.
        Change the subnet route table to let internet traffic go through.

    Access ElastiCache Redis:
        Use the public endpoint from ElastiCache to connect. We can use the Redis CLI or any Redis client library.

    Example command with Redis CLI:

    redis-cli -h <your-elasticache-public-endpoint> -p 6379

Part 5 - Connect Using Redis CLI from Your Local Machine

To connect to Amazon ElastiCache Redis from our local machine with Redis CLI, let’s follow these steps.

    Install Redis CLI: First, we need to have Redis CLI on our local machine. We can download it from the Redis website. If we use a package manager, we can install it like this:

    For macOS:

    brew install redis

    For Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install redis-tools

    Get Endpoint: Next, we get the endpoint of our ElastiCache Redis instance from the AWS Management Console. It looks like this: your-cache-endpoint.amazonaws.com:6379.

    Check Security Group: We must check that the security group for our ElastiCache instance allows inbound traffic. It should allow traffic from our local machine’s IP address on port 6379. We can do this in the AWS Management Console under Security Groups settings.

    Connect Using Redis CLI: Now, we can connect to our ElastiCache Redis instance. We use this command:

    redis-cli -h your-cache-endpoint.amazonaws.com -p 6379

    Authentication: If our Redis instance needs a password, we add the -a option with our password:

    redis-cli -h your-cache-endpoint.amazonaws.com -p 6379 -a yourpassword

    Test the Connection: After we connect, we can test our Redis connection by running a simple command:

    ping

    If the connection works, we will see a response of PONG.

Part 6 - Implement IAM Roles and Policies for Secure Access

We need to connect to Amazon ElastiCache Redis safely from outside Amazon. To do this, we should use IAM roles and policies. These will help us to limit access to our Redis instance. Here are the steps we can follow:

    Create an IAM Role:
        First, we go to the AWS IAM console.
        Next, we click on “Roles” and then “Create role”.
        We choose the service that will use this role. For example, we can pick EC2 if we are using an EC2 instance.

    Attach Policies:
        We can create a new policy or use existing ones. These policies need to give permission for ElastiCache. Here is a simple policy we can use:

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": ["elasticache:DescribeCacheClusters", "elasticache:Connect"],
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }

        This policy lets us do the actions needed on our ElastiCache Redis instance.

    Attach Role to EC2 Instances:
        If we are using EC2, we should attach the IAM role to our EC2 instance. We can do this when we create the instance or change the settings later.

    Use AWS Credentials:
        When we connect from our app, we can use the AWS SDK to get temporary credentials. For example, if we are using AWS SDK for Python (Boto3), we can do this:

    import boto3

    session = boto3.Session()
    credentials = session.get_credentials()

    Connect to ElastiCache Redis:
        Now we can use the credentials we got to connect to our Redis instance safely. We need to make sure our Redis client uses these credentials.

personally i think combination of Part 6 and Part 4 should be ok?
