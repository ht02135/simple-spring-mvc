1>Security Group for EC2

We create an EC2 instance and which will be needed to access the cluster. This EC2 instance is made a part of the default security group that is created. The idea is to login to this EC2 instance from your local machine using AWS CLI. So, we configure the below inbound condition for the default security group to allow the IP address of your local machine to SSH into the EC2 instance.

2>Security Group for Cluster

Next, we configure another security group for Redis cluster. The goal is to allow the inbound connection request from EC2 to this security group holding the cluster nodes. In the below diagram we create a security group named sg_redis_cluster and assign this security group to the Redis cluster.

In the inbound condition, we choose the connection type as custom TCP and allow the security group of the default VPC as the source.

3>Select the EndPoint

We obtain the EbdPoint of the node from the description tab of the node as shown below.

4>Connecting to Redis EndPoint

Next, we use our local machine which has AWS CLI already installed, to login to the EC2 instance we have configured above. Then navigate to the specific Redis directory as shown below and use the Redis commands to populate and retrieve values into the Redis cache.
