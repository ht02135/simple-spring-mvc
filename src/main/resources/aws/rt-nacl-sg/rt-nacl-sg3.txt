Understanding AWS Route Table: A Practical Guide

///////////////

What is a Route Table in AWS?
known as routes, that determines where network traffic is directed. Each subnet in your AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is associated with a route table that controls the traffic flow between subnets. A route table includes details like the Route Table ID and ‘The ID’ of its associated VPC.

The role of an AWS route table is to direct network traffic based on the destination IP address. Each route in the table specifies a destination (in the form of an IP address or CIDR block) and a target (like an internet gateway (IGW), network interface, or another route table). A local route is a special type of route that enables communication within the VPC.

AWS Route Tables and Security Groups: The Difference

Security groups, managed through IAM, act as firewalls for EC2 instances, whereas route tables control the routing of network traffic.

It’s critical to understand the difference between route table and Network Access Control Lists (NACL) in AWS, too. While a route table defines rules for routing network traffic, a NACL is a subnet-level firewall controlling traffic in and out of subnets.

A Network Access Control List (Network ACL, or NACL) is a firewall for a subnet.

All traffic entering or exiting a subnet is checked against the NACL rules to determine whether the traffic is allowed in/out of the subnet.

Traffic between instances within the same subnet do not pass through a NACL because the traffic is not exiting the subnet.

NACL rules are executed in a defined order. The first rule that matches the traffic will determine whether the traffic is allowed or denied.

Typically, NACLs are left at their default value of permitting all traffic. You should never have a need to modify a NACL unless you have a specific need, such as:

-----------------

A Route Table is used to direct traffic in/out of a subnet. It contains a number of CIDRs (IP address ranges) and where to direct the appropriate traffic.

For example:

    Traffic for the Internet (0.0.0.0/0) is usually:
        Sent to an Internet Gateway if the Route Table is associated with a public subnet
        Sent to a NAT Gateway if the Route Table is associated with a private subnet
    Traffic for a Peered VPC is sent across a VPC Peering connection

It literally routes the traffic to the correct destination.

Want to know what makes a Public Subnet 'public'? It is the fact that the Route Table sends Internet-bound traffic to 0.0.0.0/0.

Traffic is sent to the smallest CIDR range that matches the destination. So, traffic matching 10.1.0.0/16 would be directed before traffic matching 0.0.0.0/0.
