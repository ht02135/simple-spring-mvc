AWS VPC Creation - Step by Step

//////////////////

1>click creates vpc button.
Give the name for VPC and add IPv4 CIDR. You can use the 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR range.

2>Create Two Subnets. Firstly create a public subnet. You can use the 10.0.1.0/24 CIDR range for the public subnet

3>Now the same interface, click add new subnet button for private subnet creation.
Add IPv4 CIDR as 10.0.2.0/24. After that give the subnet name and select the availability zone.

4>Now create an internet gateway for public subnet internet access. In VPC Console select Internet Gateway and create internet gateway. Give the name of Internet Gateway and hit create button.

5>Next, we want to attach this internet gateway for VPC. You can select the internet gateway and click Attach to VPC.

Next, select the previously created VPC and click attach internet gateway button.

------------

this part is rout table part

6>Next, Go to the route table and create a route table for the public subnet. give the name for the route table and select the previously created VPC. The next click creates the route table button.

7>Click the public subnet route table click the Route tab and add route 0.0.0.0/0 and select the previously created Internet Gateway. next hit the save changes button.

8>In the public subnet route table click the subnet association section and click edit "Explicit subnet associations" section.

Next, select public subnet and click the save association button.

9>Now we go to public subnet and click subnet settings and enable "Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address" and click save.

------------

10>Next, we want to create 2 ec2 instances inside public and private subnets. Use ubuntu server 20.04 LTS AMI.

You can see the ec2 instance is up and running.

11>In the EC2 console click Elastic ip and create ELastic ip like follwing.

Next, select the newly created Elastic ip and click allocate elastic ip button.

Select previosly created public ec2 and click the associate button.

12>Next, Connect public EC2 via SSH client or EC2 Instance Connect. Try to update ubuntu. Working it means public ec2 can connect internet.

13>Now, we try to SSH into EC2 in Private Subnet. (It means bastion host). In Linux Terminal You can using the following steps.

Configuring the SSH agent using the following command.
ssh-add -L {{ssh-keyfile-name.pem}}

Next, connect the bastion host(Public EC2) using this command.
ssh â€“A ubuntu@{{Bastion-IP-address or DNS}}

Connect to the private instances from the bastion host (Agent Forwarding).
ssh ec2-user@{{InstanceIP or DNS}}

14>configure NAT for private subnet

Inside the private ec2 terminal "ping google.com" it's not given any response because it doesn't connect internet.
Private EC2 ping response

Next, go to the VPC console and create NAT Gateway. In NAT gateway creation select subnet as public subnet and give the name for NAT Gateway. 

Wait a few minutes for Nat Gateway up and running.

15>Next, Create a private route table for the private subnet. Use previous Public Route table creation same scenario. After creating the Private Route table and adding the follwing route for accessing private EC2 Internet. (select previously created nat gateway)

16>Next, add subnet association. Select private subnet and click save association button.

Finally, try to "ping google.com" inside a private subnet terminal. You can see the following output.
