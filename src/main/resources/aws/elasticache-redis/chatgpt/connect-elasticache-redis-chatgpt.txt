Configure Security Groups:
  We should change the security group of the ElastiCache Redis cluster. 
  It needs to allow incoming traffic from the EC2 instance on the Redis 
  port. The default port is 6379.
  
  We also need to make sure the EC2 instance’s security group allows 
  SSH access on port 22 from our local machine’s IP.

1. Allow EC2 to Access ElastiCache on Port 6379

Step A: Find the Security Group attached to the EC2 instance
	Go to EC2 Dashboard → Instances → Select your instance → Security tab 
	→ Note the security group name.
    
Step B: Find the Security Group attached to the ElastiCache cluster
	Go to ElastiCache Dashboard → Redis → Select your cluster → Details 
	→ Note the security group. 

Step C: Edit ElastiCache Security Group to allow EC2
    Go to EC2 > Security Groups
    Select the ElastiCache Redis cluster's security group
    Click Inbound rules > Edit inbound rules
    Add a new rule:
        Type: Custom TCP
        Port range: 6379
        Source: Select “Custom” → Choose the EC2 instance’s security group 
        (not its IP)

	Why? This allows your EC2 instance to access Redis, without exposing 
	Redis to the public internet.

2. Allow SSH Access to EC2 from Your Local Machine

Step A: Find your public IP
	You can get your IP from https://whatismyipaddress.com
Step B: Edit EC2 Security Group to Allow SSH
    Go to EC2 > Security Groups
    Select the EC2 instance's security group
    Click Inbound rules > Edit inbound rules
    Add or edit a rule:
        Type: SSH
        Port range: 22
        Source: My IP (AWS will auto-fill your current IP)
