Part 4 - Expose ElastiCache Redis via a Public IP (Not Recommended)

1>We do not recommend exposing your Amazon ElastiCache Redis instance with 
a public IP. It can cause security problems. But if we must do it, here 
are the steps.

    Modify Security Group:
        Go to the AWS Management Console.
        Click on the EC2 service and then Security Groups.
        Find the security group for your ElastiCache Redis instance.
        Add a rule for Redis (default port 6379):
            Type: Custom TCP
            Protocol: TCP
            Port Range: 6379
            Source: Your IP address (or 0.0.0.0/0 for all IPs, but this is not good)

    Here is an Example Inbound Rule:

    Type        Protocol      Port Range      Source
    Custom TCP  TCP           6379            xx.xx.xx.xx/32

    Assign Public IP:
        Make sure your ElastiCache Redis cluster is in a subnet with a public IP.
        Change the subnet route table to let internet traffic go through.

    Access ElastiCache Redis:
        Use the public endpoint from ElastiCache to connect. We can use the Redis CLI or any Redis client library.

    Example command with Redis CLI:

    redis-cli -h <your-elasticache-public-endpoint> -p 6379

Part 4 – Expose ElastiCache Redis via a Public IP (⚠️ Not Recommended)

    ⚠️ Warning:
    Exposing Amazon ElastiCache Redis to the internet is a major security risk. 
    Redis was not designed for exposure to untrusted networks, lacks built-in 
    authentication (unless configured), and cannot be encrypted by default in 
    certain older configurations.
    Proceed only in highly controlled test environments, never in production.

--------------------

Step 1: Modify the Security Group

    Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    Navigate to EC2 > Security Groups.
    Locate the Security Group attached to your ElastiCache Redis cluster.
    Add a new inbound rule:

|Type      |Protocol|Port Range|Source                                             |
|Custom TCP|TCP     |6379      |xx.xx.xx.xx/32 (your IP) or 0.0.0.0/0 (⚠️ not safe)|

Note: Use your own IP (x.x.x.x/32) to limit access.
Avoid 0.0.0.0/0 unless in a locked-down test setup with additional safeguards (e.g., 
bastion host, firewall rules).

--------------------

Step 2: Assign a Public IP (Not Normally Supported)

Amazon ElastiCache Redis is designed to be private within a VPC and does not natively 
support public IPs. However, here’s what you can try:

    Deploy Redis on EC2 instead: If public access is required, consider running 
    Redis on an EC2 instance where assigning a public IP is straightforward 
    and manageable.

    OR, create a workaround (NOT RECOMMENDED):
        Place ElastiCache in a public subnet (subnet with route to the internet).
        Use NAT Gateway or Bastion Host as a jump point.
        Use port forwarding via EC2 instance acting as a proxy (e.g., socat, 
        stunnel, or an SSH tunnel).

--------------------
    
Step 3: Access ElastiCache Redis

If you’ve managed to expose the Redis endpoint (e.g., via a proxy or tunneling method), 
connect using the Redis CLI or library:

redis-cli -h <your-elasticache-endpoint> -p 6379

    If your Redis instance has AUTH enabled, you’ll also need:

redis-cli -h <your-endpoint> -p 6379 -a <your-redis-password>

--------------------

Alternative (Safer) Approaches

If you need access to ElastiCache Redis remotely:

    SSH tunnel via Bastion Host:

ssh -L 6379:<redis-endpoint>:6379 ec2-user@<bastion-public-ip>
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379

Use AWS Systems Manager (SSM): Access Redis securely via SSM Session Manager 
with no public IPs involved.
