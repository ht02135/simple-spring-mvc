You’ve posted a fairly comprehensive Java-based integration with Amazon Cognito for user authentication and management, including:

    Sign up

    Sign in (with support for password challenge)

    Group assignment

    Password change

    Fetching user info

    JWT validation via Nimbus library

GENERAL STRUCTURE

You are using the AWS SDK for Java v1 (e.g., AWSCognitoIdentityProvider), and integrating with Spring Security. You are also using Nimbus JOSE + JWT for token verification — a good choice for custom JWT logic.
