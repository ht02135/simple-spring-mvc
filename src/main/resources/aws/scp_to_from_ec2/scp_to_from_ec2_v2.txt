///////////////

To upload a file from your laptop to Amazon instance:

$scp -i ~/Desktop/amazon.pem ~/Desktop/MS115.fa  ubuntu@ec2-54-166-128-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/data/
This command will upload a file - MS115.fa in your ~/Desktop/ folder of your laptop to folder ~/data/ on an Amazon instance. Note you still need to use the private key you used to connect to the Amazon instance with ssh. (In this example, it is the amazon.pem file in ~/Desktop/.

Similarly, to download a file from Amazon instance to your laptop:

$scp -i ~/Desktop/amazon.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-166-128-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/data/ecoli_ref-5m-trim.fastq.gz ~/Download/
This command will download a file /data/ecoli_ref-5m-trim.fastq.gz from Amazon instance to your ~/Download folder in your laptop.

note: in this day of era, using vi and emac to edit file in non-window is criminally stupid period. who still rember how to do that???  and alot of thing could go wrong too.  and you cant easily diff via winmerge...

just scp copy file to dos, edit, and then scp back...
that is how we did as implementation engineer...

this is probably even better
Using FileZilla to transfer data

Firstly, go to ‘https://filezilla-project.org/‘ and click “Download FileZilla Client” button to download it.

If you want to use FileZila to upload to or download data from a normal FTP server if you have the user and password, just put the information in the “Host”, “Username”, “Password” box and connect. However for Amazon instance, we use key-pair to log in instead of password for better safety. So it is a little bit more complicated to configure.

Open “Settings” and click “SFTP”:

Click “Add keyfile...”:

Then select the ”.pem” file you used to connect to Amazon instance with ssh.

There is a dialog box to ask you if you want to convert the ”.pem” file into a supported format. Click “Yes”.

Name it with extension as ”.ppk” and save it.

You will see the a private key has been added.

Close “Settings” and go back to the main interface.

Click button to open the site manager.

Put the Amazon instance URL like ec2-54-166-128-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com in the “Host” box. Set “Protocol” as “SFTP”, “Logon Type” as “Normal”, “User” as “ubuntu” and leave “Password” as blank. Then click “Connect”.

There will be a dialogue box to ask you about “Unknown host key”, just click “Ok”.

All right. Now you have logged in the Amazon instance. You can drag and drop to transfer the files between the remote machine and your local laptop.
