seriously i think firefox UI people is extinct or brain dead

https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-sidebar-access-bookmarks-history-synced
adding sidebar button to firefox toolbar should be default.  so user can quickly click sidebar and quickly browser which bookmark to hit.  and sidebar can be visible until user think he done with clicking bookmarks and then close...

Add the Sidebar button to your controls

    Click the menu button Fx89menuButton, then click More tools and select Customize Toolbarâ€¦ A panel will open with all the controls you can add to Firefox.
    Drag and drop the Sidebar button to your menu or toolbar. It's your choice!

at least one sanity thing is they still kept ublock origin.
